# Beta Testing

## Alex Ha (CS Pro)
- Game is very pollished and easy to understand and play.
- Lacks gameplay and player feedback when damage is done.
- Could have been more ambisious with more gameplay.

## FÃ©lix Lin (No CS knowledge)
- relies too much on luck
- good idea and good try

## My Notes
- Feedback I received wasn't very helpful, but did help me realise that my game was not that great. The only thing my testers were wowed by was the sound and animations, saying it looks really ggod, but is way too simple to be a proper Pokemon game, which is true.
