# **Major Project Reflection

## Goal For Assignement
- My goal for the assignment was to get a very simple, dimmed down version of Pokemon showdown working. Unfortunately, I only partially acheived that goal. The game kind of works, but is missing many key features a Pokemon game requires.

## What I got from my proposal
Y for yes I have, N for no I don't have
### Needs to Have List
- 4 pokemon to give the player randomly - Y
- Moves for each pokemon - Y but not In the way I wanted
- Types interactions - N
- A start screen - Y
- sound effects and background noise - Y
- HP, ATK, DEF, SPD, SPA, SPE stats - Y


### Nice to Have List
- More Pokemon - N
- Proper damage calculator Y (mostly)
- Multiple pokemon per player - N
- two player - N
    - local
    - online
- attack animations - N
- animated sprites - Y
- Menu with game options - N
- Text boxes saying what moved was used, if the move missed, if the pokemon fainted - N

## Why I think I wasn't able to acheive my goal. 
I hadn't realized what went into a pokemon game, and I hadn't familiarized myself with the concepts that were going to needed for this. I feel my code is clunky and ugly, and if i were to restart this assignement all over again, I would 100% find a better, more efficent way to write my code. I Kept running into the issue where once one thing was done, a new one came up, so the lift of what I needed to get done felt like it was never ending. The other issue 


## My thoughts on the final project
I'm both proud and dissapointed at myself. Although I didn't complete my game, I showed myself that I can do stuff like thisand I am capable of computer coding. I am still very upset that I wasn't able to complete it, because in my brain, it is such a simple game, but I made it complicated, which caused me issues and rather than stopping and fixing it, I just kept digging the hole deeper. It wasn't until the last few days where I started code 2, which I feel that if I started with that from the beginning, I would be able to complete my game. 

If this were up to me, I'd give myself maybe a 7/10 as I was able to check off most of my needs to have, but it's ugly, inefficent and not complete.
